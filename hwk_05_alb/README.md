# Homework 05

## A Temperature Conversion App w/ ALB

## Instructions
In this homework I am expecting you to build a docker image that can be used to run a simple temperature conversion web app. The app should take a temperature in Fahreinheit and display its value converted to Celsius. The code for this app is given to you and your only job is to deploy 2 containers of this app on an ECS instance. Port mapping should be 3000:8000 and 3001:8000. The ECS ports 3000 and 3001 should be left open for public access so I can test each container separately. The ALB should be on port 80.  

## Submission

For this assignment you just need to share with me the link of your ALB and ECS so I can test them remotely.
