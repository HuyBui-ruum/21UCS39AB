# Homework 04

## A Docker w/ RDS + Web Front End

## Goal
In this homework I am expecting you to build a docker image that can be used to run a simple web app with dynamic content built from information stored in a RDS database. Your docker image should be published on docker HUB. 

You can use the dollar2real as a starting point. However, you cannot use the same website for scraping exchange rates. You are required to do something different. 

## Requirements

* a web interface that displays some dynamically generated content 
* docker image publicly available on docker hub
* uses AWS RDS to store dynamic data

## Submission

For this assignment you just need to share with me the link of your image on docker hub and (if needed) instructions on how to run it as a container (eg, environment variables that need to be passed, port mapping, etc.).
